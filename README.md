**Raku Butterfly** is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) engineered for the Raku programming language. It focuses on providing a fast, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing coding experience, inspired by the elegance and transformative nature of a butterfly.

This repository contains the full source code, development files, and engineering assets for the `wryesvha` desktop application.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to support a clear separation of concerns for IDE engineers and developers. Understanding this structure is key to contributing effectively.

### Directory Guide

*   `bin/`: Contains the main executable script(s). This is the entry point for the application.
*   `lib/`: The heart of the application. All core Raku source code (`.rakumod`, `.rakutest`) resides here.
*   `test/`: The test suite. We use Raku's standard `Test` module. All files ending in `.t` are executed by the test runner.
*   `doc/`: Project documentation, including development guides, architecture overviews, and API references.
*   `image/`: Static image assets, icons, and themes used by the application's user interface.
*   `debug/`: **Development-Only.** This directory is for files generated during a debug session. It is git-ignored but crucial for development. It holds detailed logs, crash reports, and build artifacts from debug compilations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Raku](https://raku.org/downloads/) (v2023.11 or newer)
*   [Zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef) - Raku's standard module installer.
*   A GUI Backend Library (e.g., `GTK+`, `Cairo`). This project may have specific dependencies listed in `META6.json`.

## Getting Started: Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/wryesvha.git
    cd wryesvha
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use `zef` to install all required modules listed in `META6.json`.
    ```bash
    zef install --deps-only .
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Execute the main script from the `bin` directory. The `-Ilib` flag tells Raku to look for modules in our `lib` folder.
    ```bash
    raku -Ilib bin/butterfly
    ```

## Usage

To launch Raku Butterfly, simply run the main executable:

```bash
./bin/butterfly
```

For command-line options and help:

```bash
./bin/butterfly --help
```

## Development & Debugging

Engineers working on this project should utilize the built-in debugging features.

### Enabling Debug Mode

Run the application with the `BUTTERFLY_DEBUG` environment variable set to `1`. This will enable verbose logging and other debug-time checks.

```bash
BUTTERFLY_DEBUG=1 raku -Ilib bin/butterfly
```

### Debug Files

*   **Logs:** When in debug mode, detailed logs are written to `./debug/logs/app.log`. This is the first place to look when troubleshooting.
*   **Crash Dumps:** In the event of a critical failure, the application will attempt to write a core dump or stack trace to the `./debug/dumps/` directory.

## Running Tests

This project uses the standard Raku testing harness. You can run the entire test suite using the `prove` utility.

```bash
# Run all tests verbosely from the project root
prove -e "raku -I." -vr test/
```

## Documentation

Project documentation is located in the `doc/` directory. For an in-depth guide on the project's architecture and contribution workflow, please read `doc/development.md`.
